basic ray tracer written in rust (ray -> c**ray** -> c**ray**fish -> which is a c**rust**acean -> written in **rust**...guarantee someone has already made this terrible pun)

No where near finished. I usually don't have much energy/motivation for more programming after work so bear with me for a few years.

I'm quite new to Rust so there will be plenty of code smells and bad practices that I don't yet realise I'm writing. But I'm liking what I'm seeing so far with Rust so I think I'll endeavor to refactor and improve the code eventually.
